You should strive to strike a balance between:\\n\\n- Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\\n- Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\\n  - For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\\n- Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\\n</proactiveness>\\n\\n<following_conversations>\\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\\n\\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\\n</following_conversations>\\n\\n<code_style>\\n- Follow existing code style and patterns\\n- Do not add any comments to code you write unless asked to do so\\n</code_style>\\n\\n<doing_tasks>\\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\\n\\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query.\\n- Plan out the implementation\\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\\n- When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CRUSH.md so that you will know to run it next time.\\n\\nNEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked.\\n</doing_tasks>\\n\\n<tool_use>\\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Agent tool in order to reduce context usage.\\n- All tools are executed in parallel when multiple tool calls are sent in a single message. Only send multiple tool calls when they are safe to run in parallel (no dependencies between them).\\n- The user does not see the full output of the tool responses, so if you need the output of the tool for the response make sure to summarize it for the user.\\n</tool_use>\\n\\n<env>\\nWorking directory: /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openrouter-kimi-k2/download_tool\\nIs directory a git repo:  no \\nPlatform: darwin\\nToday's date: 1/1/2025\\n</env>\\n<memory>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</memory>\\n\\n\",\"role\":\"system\"},{\"content\":\"download the file from https://httpbin.org/robots.txt and save it as robots.txt\",\"role\":\"user\"}],\"model\":\"moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905\",\"max_tokens\":10000,\"stream_options\":{\"include_usage\":true},\"tool_choice\":\"auto\",\"tools\":[{\"function\":{\"name\":\"bash\",\"strict\":false,\"description\":\"Executes bash commands in persistent shell session with timeout and security measures.\\n\\n<cross_platform>\\nUses mvdan/sh interpreter (Bash-compatible on all platforms including Windows).\\nUse forward slashes for paths: \\\"ls C:/foo/bar\\\" not \\\"ls C:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\".\\nCommon shell builtins and core utils available on Windows.\\n</cross_platform>\\n\\n<execution_steps>\\n1.

Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\\n\\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\\n</following_conversations>\\n\\n<code_style>\\n- Follow existing code style and patterns\\n- Do not add any comments to code you write unless asked to do so\\n</code_style>\\n\\n<doing_tasks>\\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\\n\\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query.\\n- Plan out the implementation\\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\\n- When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CRUSH.md so that you will know to run it next time.\\n\\nNEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked.\\n</doing_tasks>\\n\\n<tool_use>\\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Agent tool in order to reduce context usage.\\n- All tools are executed in parallel when multiple tool calls are sent in a single message. Only send multiple tool calls when they are safe to run in parallel (no dependencies between them).\\n- The user does not see the full output of the tool responses, so if you need the output of the tool for the response make sure to summarize it for the user.\\n</tool_use>\\n\\n<env>\\nWorking directory: /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openrouter-kimi-k2/download_tool\\nIs directory a git repo:  no \\nPlatform: darwin\\nToday's date: 1/1/2025\\n</env>\\n<memory>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</memory>\\n\\n\",\"role\":\"system\"},{\"content\":\"download the file from https://httpbin.org/robots.txt and save it as robots.txt\",\"role\":\"user\"},{\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"TestCoderAgent/openrouter-kimi-k2/download_tool-1\",\"function\":{\"arguments\":\"{\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://httpbin.org/robots.txt\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"robots.txt\\\"}\",\"name\":\"download\"},\"type\":\"function\"}],\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"Successfully downloaded 30 bytes to /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openrouter-kimi-k2/download_tool/robots.txt (Content-Type: text/plain)\",\"tool_call_id\":\"TestCoderAgent/openrouter-kimi-k2/download_tool-1\",\"role\":\"tool\"}],\"model\":\"moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905\",\"max_tokens\":10000,\"stream_options\":{\"include_usage\":true},\"tool_choice\":\"auto\",\"tools\":[{\"function\":{\"name\":\"bash\",\"strict\":false,\"description\":\"Executes bash commands in persistent shell session with timeout and security measures.\\n\\n<cross_platform>\\nUses mvdan/sh interpreter (Bash-compatible on all platforms including Windows).\\nUse forward slashes for paths: \\\"ls C:/foo/bar\\\" not \\\"ls C:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\".\\nCommon shell builtins and core utils available on Windows.\\n</cross_platform>\\n\\n<execution_steps>\\n1.
